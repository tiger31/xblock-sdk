# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.

# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# These packages are backports which can only be installed on Python 2.7
futures ; python_version == "2.7"

# These packages still support Python 2.7, and are required for compatibility with Django 1.11
